Welcome to afpy.barcamp documentation!
======================================

*afpy.barcamp* was created to manage sessions and people registrations at PyCon FR
2008.

Installation:
-------------
You can try afpy.barcamp on Linux (and maybe MacOs X) in an isolated sandbox.
You first have to install Python 2.5 and Mercurial::

  $ sudo aptitude install python2.5 mercurial

Then create the sandbox::

  $ hg clone https://hg.afpy.org/afpy.barcamp/
  $ cd afpy.barcamp
  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout

When it's finished, you can run the application::

  $ ./bin/zopectl fg

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser

The admin account is admin/admin. After login, just create an application in the
Grok administration panel, click on the new application. Now you can create a
new event and allow people to register.
