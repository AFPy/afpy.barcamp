unit test for registration
==========================
:Test-Layer: unit

By registration, we mean registering to an event in the real life, ie attending
a conference or a meeting. We want to track the people list in PyCon FR

We create a dummy object (be it a meeting or seance):

  >>> class Dummy(object)
          pass

We want this object to be registrable:

  >>> classImplements(Dummy, IRegistrable)

We create an instance of the object:

  >>> dummy = Dummy()

Ok, now we can get a registration adapter:

  >>> registration = IRegistration(dummy)

We don't have anybody registered:

  >>> list(registration.everybody())
  []

We can check 'ccomb' is not registered:

  >>> registration.is_registered('ccomb')
  False

We can register him:

  >>> registration.register('ccomb')

Ok, now ccomb is registered and is in the list:

  >>> registration.is_registered('ccomb')
  True
  >>> list(registration.everybody())
  ['ccomb']

We can do the same with gawel:

  >>> registration.register('gawel')

gawel is also registered and is in the list:

  >>> registration.is_registered('gawel')
  True
  >>> sorted(list(registration.everybody()))
  ['ccomb', 'gawel']

Then we unregister ccomb:

  >>> registration.unregister('ccomb')

ccomb is no more registered and is not in the list:

  >>> registration.is_registered('ccomb')
  False
  >>> list(registration.everybody())
  ['gawel']
